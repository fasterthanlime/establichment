To viewers: I'm borrowing code from my LD 22 entry, 'alone'. But I'm trying to learn from my mistakes. This time, I'm separating Display from MainUI. The UI system will be abstract, and will only use SDL under the hood

I've decided to abstract display and input into a separate library, since I like the 'Input' class from my LD22 entry but I feel bad to just copy/paste it into my new one :) You'll see how easy it is to make a new ooc library.

Turns out I have done quite a lot of ooc bindings in my time :) or at least forked/improved on others (@fredreichbier, @eagle2com, others I forget here, sorry!)
Woops, it's not the SDL version I thought it was. That's better. I actually have push access to eagle2com's repo.

Separation is done, lib is here! https://github.com/nddrylliog/ldkit
